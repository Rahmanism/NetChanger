# Introduction
If you use Microsoft Windows on your laptop, then every time you go to work or go back to home, you to have connect to a different wifi network. In some cases (like mine) you have to set a static IP address on a wifi and use DHCP on another.
This goal of this windows app is to go between DHCP and static IP easily.

# Getting Started
It has a main settings form. You can set a default IP settings there.
There will be a system tray menu, so you can switch the network status fast enough.
